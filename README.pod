=head1 NAME

Data::Dict - Hash-based dictionary object

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Data::Dict;

  my $dictionary = Data::Dict->new(a => 1, b => 2, c => 3);
  delete $dictionary->{b};
  say join "\n", $dictionary->keys;

  $dictionary->slice(qw(a b))->grep(sub { defined $_[1] })->each(sub {
    my ($key, $value) = @_;
    say "$key: $value";
  });

  use Data::Dict 'd';
  d(%counts)->values(sub { $_++ });

=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<Data::Dict> is a hash-based container for dictionaries.

  # Access hash directly to manipulate dictionary
  my $dict = Data::Dict->new(a => 1, b => 2, c => 3);
  $dict->{b} += 100;
  say for values %$dict;

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 d

  my $dict = d(a => 1, b => 2);

Construct a new hash-based L<Data::Dict> object. Exported on demand.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

  my $dict = Data::Dict->new(a => 1, b => 2);

Construct a new hash-based L<Data::Dict> object.

=head2 TO_JSON

Alias for L</"to_hash">.

=head2 each

  my @pairs = $dict->each;
  $dict     = $dict->each(sub {...});

Evaluate callback for each pair in the dictionary, or return pairs as list of
key/value arrayrefs if none has been provided. The callback will receive the
key and value as arguments, and the key is also available as C<$_>.

  $dict->each(sub {
    my ($key, $value) = @_;
    say "$key: $value";
  });

=head2 grep

  my $new = $dict->grep(qr/foo/);
  my $new = $dict->grep(sub {...});

Evaluate regular expression on each key, or call callback on each key/value
pair in the dictionary, and return a new dictionary with all pairs that matched
the regular expression, or for which the callback returned true. The callback
will receive the key and value as arguments, and the key is also available as
C<$_>.

  my $banana_dict = $dict->grep(qr/banana/);

  my $fruits_dict = $dict->grep(sub { $_[1]->isa('Fruit') });

=head2 keys

  my @keys = $dict->keys;
  $dict    = $dict->keys(sub {...});

Evaluate callback for each key in the dictionary, or return all keys as a list
if none has been provided. The key will be the first argument passed to the
callback, and is also available as C<$_>.

=head2 map

  my @results = $dict->map(sub { ... });

Evaluate callback for each key/value pair in the dictionary and return the
results as a list. The callback will receive the key and value as arguments,
and the key is also available as C<$_>.

  my @pairs = $dict->map(sub { [@_] });

=head2 size

  my $size = $dict->size;

Number of keys in dictionary.

=head2 slice

  my $new = $dict->slice(@keys);

Create a new dictionary with all selected keys.

  print join ' ', d(a => 1, b => 2, c => 3)->slice('a', 'c')->map(sub { join ':', @_ });
  # a:1 c:3

=head2 tap

  $dict = $dict->tap(sub {...});

Perform callback and return the dictionary object for further chaining, as in
L<Mojo::Base/"tap">. The dictionary object will be the first argument passed to
the callback, and is also available as C<$_>.

=head2 to_array

  my $array = $dict->to_array;

Turn dictionary into even-sized array reference.

=head2 to_hash

  my $hash = $dict->to_hash;

Turn dictionary into hash reference.

=head2 values

  my @values = $dict->values;
  $dict      = $dict->values(sub {...});

Evaluate callback for each value in the dictionary, or return all values as a
list if none has been provided. The value will be the first argument passed to
the callback, and is also available as C<$_>.
